## Setup Instructions

1.  **Create a `.env` file** in the root directory of the project.
2.  **Add your Discord Bot Token** to the `.env` file. It should look like this:
    ```
    DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN="YOUR_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN_HERE"
    ```
3.  **The Grok API Key is already included** in the `.env` file.
4.  **Install the required dependencies** by running the following command in your terminal:
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
5.  **Run the bot** using the following command:
    ```
    python main.py
    ```
